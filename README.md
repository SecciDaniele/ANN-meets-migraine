This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed to classify migraine conditions based on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The script implements preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification steps to facilitate accurate identification of migraine conditions.

Context and Purpose

The goal of this script is to support the research described in the upcoming publication (details will be shared upon acceptance). The dataset used in the analysis is available upon request, as described in the publication. This repository provides an open framework for replicating and building upon the described methodology.
