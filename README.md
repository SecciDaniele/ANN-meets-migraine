This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed to classify migraine conditions based on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The script implements preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification steps to facilitate accurate identification of migraine conditions.

# Context and Purpose

The goal of this script is to support the research described in the upcoming publication (details will be shared upon acceptance). The dataset used in the analysis is available upon request, as described in the publication. This repository provides an open framework for replicating and building upon the described methodology.

# Requirements
MATLAB (R2020b or later recommended)

Deep learning toolbox.

# Dataset
The dataset required for running this script is not included in the repository. It can be obtained upon request as specified in the forthcoming publication.

# Code Overview
The script consists of the following main components:
Two scripts are present in this repository. One is using the feed forward feature selection as reference method for selecting critical features, the second one the principal component analysis technique is implemented to reduece the dataset dimensionality.
